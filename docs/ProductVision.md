# Product Name
Interactive Schedule

## Vision Statement
Towards a more informed future.
For students who want to be on time.
The Interactive Schedule is an app which helps students to meet schedules by letting them know all class options they have and their way to the classroom without getting lost in the interminable FEUP hallways.
Unlike UNI, our app will help students improve their time efficiency - by physically finding the best path through college as well as allowing them to not waste more time trying to figure out when which class is. It will also provide all professors' information that they may need. 

## Main Features

 - Alternative theoretical classes - Being able to view different theoretical classes from other timetables (and the option chosen is saved on the phone).
 - Classroom notifications - Receiving a notification of what class and classroom the student will attend 10 minutes before its beginning. It will also show, when the notification is touched upon, the school map and the path between classrooms.
 - School map - Seeing where the classroom physically is in the building.
 - Detailed timetable - The possibility to obtain more information about a class by selecting it from a timetable.
 - Professor's information - Being able to see their contact information.
 - Professor's schedule - Being able to check professor's schedules (too see where they are teaching).
 - Scholar calendar - See when the classes are interrupted (for vacation).
