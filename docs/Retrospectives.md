## Retrospective 1


### What went well?

    We worked well as a team. The work was equitably divided between the members. 
    The amount of effort required for each task was adequate.

### What should we do differently?

    Start working sooner in the iteration. 
    Check with the monitors when questions arise. 

### What still puzzles me?
    
    We still dont feel comfortable when using  certain Android Studio functionalities.

## Retrospective 2


### What went well?

    The team showed a better understanding about what concerned dart and Android functionalities comparing with the previous iteration.

### What should we do differently?

    Do a better use of the monitors' help outside classes.

### What still puzzles me?
    
   How the Uni app code is structured and linked. it sometimes gets difficult to understand.

## Retrospective 3


### What went well?
  
  Even though we had to remake some mockups, the work seemed easier on this last iteration, due to the fact that we are getting better at
  working as a team, and working with the new language.
### What should we do differently?

  Looking back we could have distributed better some tasks so the workload would be less.
### What still puzzles me?
    

  Why sometimes the emulators would simply stop working.
